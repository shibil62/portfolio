                <div><p class="information-1">I'm a CSE First year student from India . I love Computer Science cause i like to build stuff like websites, application etc. Eventhough i'm not an expert in this , i'm learning and adapting every day.I'm just a boy who's so curious. I find coding interesting and funny but frustrating sometimes(Obviously). I'm a guy with lot of hobbies which includes coding which i find fascinating.

                    <br>
                   I started liking Computer science when i was 16 years old and now iam 18(I know , not long right). Whenever i see a website or softwares and applications which looks so good i always wondered how they made it and i want to make similar one too but i wasn't good at it. If you are viewing this website i'm still not an expert or someone who can do advanced stuff. I'm just a guy who is always curious about how things work and wondered how they are making it and thinks like i wanna make one too. In my school years i was not a topper nor at the bottom of the class in grades.<br>
                    <br>
                    The only subjects which i liked to study in my highschool years ever was maths and english(Cause there's nothing much to study;not maths LOL). But when i came to higher secondary i choose CS when most of my friends where going for Bio. To be honest i don't why i choose CS but it suddenly started to be my favourite and i started to find it fascinating and i realised what should i pursue in my collage . But before going into collage i tried Entrance exam but i couldn't get into a Govt collage cause i messed up my physics and chemistry, Yes i hated these two subjects more than anything(Still do).Whatever , i'm studying CSE now and i need to be the best in it and that all it matters.<br>
                    <br>
