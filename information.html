                <div><p class="information-1">I'm a CSE first-year student from India. I love Computer Science because I like to build stuff like websites, applications, etc. Even though I'm not an expert in this, I'm learning and adapting every day. I'm just a boy who's so curious. I find coding interesting and funny but frustrating sometimes (obviously). I'm a guy with a lot of hobbies, which includes coding, which I find fascinating.

                    <br>
                   I started liking Computer Science when I was 16 years old and now I am 18 (I know, not long right). Whenever I see a website or software and applications which look so good, I always wondered how they made it and I want to make similar ones too, but I wasn't good at it. If you are viewing this website, I'm still not an expert or someone who can do advanced stuff. I'm just a guy who is always curious about how things work and wonders how they are making it and thinks like <b><i>I wanna make one too</b></i>. In my school years, I was not a topper nor at the bottom of the class in grades.<br>
                    <br>
                    The only subjects which I liked to study in my high school years were maths and English (cause there's nothing much to study; not maths LOL). But when I came to higher secondary, I chose CS when most of my friends were going for Bio. To be honest, I don't know why I chose CS, but it suddenly started to be my favourite and I started to find it fascinating, and I realised what I should pursue in my college. But before going into college, I tried the entrance exam, but I couldn't get into a govt college because I messed up my physics and chemistry. Yes, I hated these two subjects more than anything (still do). Whatever, I'm studying CSE now and I need to be the best in it, and that's all that matters.<br>
